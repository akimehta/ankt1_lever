Hi, my name is Ankit Mehta. I am currently working as a Business Technology Partner at [Tabcorp](https://www.tabcorp.com.au/) within the Strategy, Architecture, Design and Engineering (SADE) team. I was born in India and have made Australia my home since 2016. Life has been nothing but a beautiful journey so far. I am always in awe of the world we live in and inspired by the life and great works of nature. 

I am an avid book-reader and always happy to give some nice suggestions. Some of my favourite authors are Mith Albom, Jeffrey Archer, Dan Brown, and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. I am now trying to explore more Indian authors and authors from countries other than the USA and UK. If you have any suggestions for me, please get in touch.
