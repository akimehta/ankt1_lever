Hi, my name is Ankit Mehta. I am currently working as a Business Technology Partner at [Tabcorp](https://www.tabcorp.com.au/) within the Strategy, Architecture, Design and Engineering (SADE) team. I was born in India and have made Australia my home since 2016. Life has been nothing but a beautiful journey so far. I am always in awe of the world we live in and inspired by the life and great works of nature. 

I am an avid book-reader and always happy to give some nice suggestions. Some of my favourite authors are [Mitch Albom](https://www.mitchalbom.com/home/), [Jeffrey Archer](https://www.jeffreyarcher.com/), [Dan Brown](https://danbrown.com/), and [Sir Arthur Conan Doyle](https://www.arthurconandoyle.com/). I am now trying to explore more Indian authors and authors from countries other than the USA and UK. If you have any suggestions for me, please get in touch. 

I love travelling and exploring places, their people and culture, history and art. I am always intrigued by how similar yet different we are. While we are all humans built with the same elements trying to find our meaning and place in this world, at the same time our habits, disciplin, routines and beliefs are different. We are all beautiful and potentially harmful. We are all forgiving and potentially spiteful. We are all honest and potentially corrupt. The world is a funny place and us humans, we always have a choice. I believe exploring history doesn't mean remembering relevant events and people from the past, it means learning about the choices we humans made to reach where we are today. Imagine even a slightest change to any choice, the world would have been a completely different place - better or worse. 

Since the [Covid-19 lockdowns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_lockdowns), I became very interested in personal finances and productivity. Productivity influencers and gurus were at their peak during the time on all social media. I admit got influenced by them... and for better I must say. My focus and disciplin has improved (not perfect but better now). I have become mindful of my health and personal wealth. I started exploring different ways of managing and investing my money for a secured future. Overall, it has improved my life's journey. Some of the people I recommend are [Matt D'Avella](https://www.mattdavella.com/), [JoeySchweitzer](https://www.betterideas.com/), and ['The Minimalists'](https://www.theminimalists.com/about/) - Joshua Millburn and Ryan Nicodemus.
