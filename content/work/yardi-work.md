## The story
Fresh out of my Masters degree, I got recruited into [Yardi Software India Pvt. Ltd.](https://www.yardi.com/about-us/) as an intern. My first paid corporate job. I still remember the first day of work. Colourful butterflies in my stomach and heaps of dreams to quickly learn and climb the corporate ladder. I had to learn VB.Net programming on-the-go and an in-house framework that the initial developers at Yardi built called Cafe framework. I was proficcient with C#.Net and ASP.Net so it didn't take me a while to get a grasp of VB.Net. 

Yardi makes ERP software for property management industry. The users include property managers, builders, contractors, brokers, tenants, and other professionals in the property market. 

### Build a new broker portal
When I joined Yardi, they were planning to build some online portals for the end users. One of them was a broker portal. I was tasked with building this portal from scratch using VB.Net and Cafe framework. There were a few complexities involved in the execution of this product (or portal). 
* One broker can be working for multiple property management companies.
* One broker can have multiple tenants and multiple sites.
* One tenant can have contract with multiple properties by the same broker.
* The APIs must be able to fetch new available properties for brokerage from multiple property management companies' systems. The broker can then, within the platform, approach these companies and show an interest in selling their listed properties.

The user of this platform was a broker and the main features of the product were:
* They must be able to view all the available properties on the market that they can show an interest in selling. 
* They must be able to list their properties on the platform. This platform was then connected to a marketplace portal where tenants could search for properties.
* They must be able to schedule the property inspections.
* They must be able to record the condition of the property and print or send condition reports.
* They must be able to view the details of tenants who have signed a contract with them.
* They must get notifications on nearing of annual contract renewals, messages from the tenants via the tenant portal and any new hot properties on the market.

Yes, this was a massive take for my very first professional project and I was the only person implementing it. I had huge help from my team leader and project manager and was able to complete the product development on time. This was the first time I was working in a Waterfall method and learned its benefits. I believe working in Agile method is not a solution to every problem. Every software development life cycle has its own pros and cons. One needs to learn, understand and weigh it before deciding the correct approach.

After 6 months, I was converted from an intern to a Software Developer. 

The project was a huge success and I got lots of appreciation senior management.
