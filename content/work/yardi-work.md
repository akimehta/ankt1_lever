Fresh out of my Masters degree, I got recruited into [Yardi Software India Pvt. Ltd.](https://www.yardi.com/about-us/) as an intern. My first paid corporate job. I still remember the first day of work. Colourful butterflies in my stomach and heaps of dreams to quickly learn and climb the corporate ladder. I had to learn VB.Net programming on-the-go and an in-house framework that the initial developers at Yardi built called Cafe framework. I was proficcient with C#.Net and ASP.Net so it didn't take me a while to get a grasp of VB.Net. 

Yardi makes ERP software for property management industry. The users include property managers, builders, contractors, brokers, tenants, and other professionals in the property market. 

## Build a new broker portal
When I joined Yardi, they were planning to build some online portals.
