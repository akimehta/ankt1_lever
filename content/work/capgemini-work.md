## The story
I love change. My work from home desk setup keeps getting changed every few weeks. I am currently sitting at my work desk facing towards my room's east wall with a window to my left. A few weeks later, I am planning to change my setting to face toward the window with the east wall to my right. This is the same with my work as well. I love working on different projects rather than working on and supporting a single product. During one of my meditation sessions, I figured it is simply because I am a very curious person and someone who just enjoys learning something new. To quench my thirst for knowledge and experience, I love changes. 

I thought working for a big consultancy firm would be perfect! I would get to work on multiple projects with multiple clients. I joined Capgemini as a Senior Consultant and since day one, I was on the client side with ANZ Bank as a Senior Technical Business Analyst on a major enterprise-wide cloud transformation project. ANZ Bank had decided to migrate more than 3000 on-premises applications to GCP and AWS cloud environments. 

I was the only BA responsible for both streams of migrations (AWS and GCP). It was a fantastic experience working with very senior cloud architects and security architects. This project had a lot of "first times" for me.

For the first time:
* I was working with multiple geographically distributed teams.
* I was working on end-to-end cloud migration. I documented and formalised Migration Delivery Playbook used for internal and external audit.
* I was working in a Scaled Agile environment.
* I was working with Confluence and JIRA systems. I built and maintained a centralised knowledge base in Confluence for all re-platform migration resources enabling quick and smooth knowledge transfer and decision-making.
* Since I was the only BA in the entire project, I was working from 9 am to 10 pm every day. 9 am to 3 pm with the ANZ team (clients) and 3 pm to 10 pm with the technical delivery team (architects, developers, and testers from different countries).
* I performed the role of a Scrum Master.

All of these "first time" experiences helped me gain a lot of knowledge in and about the industry and I will always be extremely thankful to my colleagues and managers at Capgemini and ANZ Bank.
