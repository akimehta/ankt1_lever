"Once you get a job in the energy industry, you are set for life!", told my friend Abhishek when I got the role as a Business Analyst in Next Business Energy. 
"Once you are in the energy indsutry, either you get frustrated in four months and quit or fall in love with the chaos and stay forever", said one of the managers on my first day of joining.
Well, I my journey with the industry lasted for six months. 

It is an interesting and extremely complex industry but a bit too chaotic for my liking to be honest. Since it was a small firm, I could get a first hand experience of how the entire energy retail machinery operates. I never gave a thought about all the behind the scenes complexities while paying my energy bill every month or switching from one energy retailer to another every few months. Hence, I have a huge respect for everyone working in this industry. 

In my fairly short stint at Next Business Energy, I had the opportunity to lead two major projects and become an SME for a part of the backbone software system of this company - [Orion](https://orion-alliance.com/energy-utilities). 

## Perform gap analysis
On my day 2 of joining the company, I was tasked with drawing and documenting all the business processes for all the departments. This included but were not limited to Sales, Marketing, Regulation and Compliance, Wholesale, Customer Service, Technology, Operations, Administration, Billing, Customer Delivery, and Executive Leadership. The last time the business processes were documented was 5 years ago and the company had evolved a lot since. I used [Lucidchart](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/) and BPMN 2.0 representation to draw and create detailed current state business process maps. I engaged with almost every employee in every team to develop this using the following methods:
* Individual interviews
* Group interviews
* Workshops
* Questionnaire
* Shadowing them for the entire day

It took me 3 months to finally draw all the process maps. This followed by a chain of presentations, feedback sessions, and sign-offs from stakeholders, senior managers and executive leadership team. 

Aftermath:
* I found a significant revenue leakage in the Sales business processes. This was immediately actioned and fixed by upper management.
* The leadership team was able to identify the gaps and streamline a lot of their administration and customer delivery processes.
* They had a visual representation of an ideal process roadmap that the teams could work towards. 

## Help the company enter a new market
It is 2021 and the entire world is talking about sustainable energy. Next Business Energy's customers are small to medium size businesses and the company wanted to accomplish two goals:
* Enter the Queensland market
* Offer up to 100% carbon offset (renewable energy) products to their customers

I got an opportunity to lead this project. My team and I engaged with a third-party vendor who had built a platform where people could sell and purchase excess energy generated from their solar panels. This was a very innovative solution which required integration with our internal enterprise system - Orion. This was not an easy task and required constant project coordination between the vendor providing this platform and the support and development team of Orion. I was responsible for engaging and managing relations with the vendor, project coordination, preparing the project plan, business requirements documents, systems integration documentation, and data and entity mapping documentation.

Aftermath of the project:
* The company was able to set up its base in regional Queensland
* The customers (mainly small to medium businesses) were happy as they could now sell their excess solar energy and make some money off of it. On the other end, they were happy to access renewable energy at better rates.
* The customers were also able to provide these benefits to their employees and attract more workforce.
